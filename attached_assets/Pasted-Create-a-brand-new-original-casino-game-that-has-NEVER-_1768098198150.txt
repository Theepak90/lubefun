Create a brand-new original casino game that has NEVER been seen on gambling websites.

Game name: SPLIT OR STEAL (can be renamed later)

Core concept:
- Two outcomes: Split or Steal
- Player bets an amount.
- A shared “pot” grows during a short suspense phase.
- At the end, the game randomly chooses SPLIT or STEAL.
- SPLIT: player wins a percentage of the pot.
- STEAL: house takes the pot (player loses bet).

Gameplay flow:
1. Player enters bet amount.
2. A suspense timer starts (3–5 seconds) with animated buildup.
3. Pot visually grows during the countdown.
4. Outcome is revealed: SPLIT or STEAL.
5. Winnings or loss shown instantly.
6. Player can instantly replay.

Logic requirements:
- Outcome must be provably random (client-side simulation for now).
- House edge must be configurable (e.g. 2–6%).
- SPLIT chance slightly higher than STEAL, but STEAL payout risk balances it.
- Pot growth is cosmetic but tied to final payout.
- Add streak logic (multiple SPLITS feel exciting, STEAL feels brutal).

Payout logic example (can be tuned):
- SPLIT chance: 58–62%
- STEAL chance: 38–42%
- SPLIT payout: bet × 1.8 to 2.4 (weighted randomness)
- Expected value controlled via house edge variable.

Addiction & fun mechanics:
- Very fast rounds (under 5 seconds).
- Big, dramatic animations and sounds.
- “Just one more” replay button.
- Streak indicators (🔥 hot streak, ❄ cold streak).
- Fake “other players just won/lost” ticker (simulated).

UI requirements:
- Large full-card visual (like Dice, but more dramatic).
- Clean, modern, Stake-style design.
- Two massive outcome visuals: SPLIT (green/blue), STEAL (red/orange).
- Pot counter animation.
- Mobile-friendly layout.

Tech requirements:
- Works fully client-side for now.
- Easy to later connect to backend.
- House edge configurable in one place.
- Code must be clean and modular.

Goal:
A highly addictive, fast-paced, original casino game that feels new, exciting, and brutal in a fun way, with full control over randomness and house edge.
