The Live Blackjack table still looks broken/cheap (chips floating, cards dealing badly, side bets unclear, layout inconsistent between betting and dealing). Fix it properly with a full UI/UX pass and correct positioning system.

GOAL

Make Blackjack look premium, stable, and “live-casino” quality: clean felt table, proper chip stacks on bet spots, correct card dealing animation that lands in the right places, and side bets that are visibly placed + resolved.

1) Build a real layout grid (stop random absolute positions)

Create a single Table coordinate system component that all positions use (seats, bet spots, hand areas, dealer area, shoe).

Use normalized anchors (percent-based) so it scales reliably at any screen size.

The table must not shift between betting phase and dealing phase.

All seats and their bet/hand anchors remain fixed.

2) Premium table visuals (replace cheap felt)

Replace current background with a clean premium felt: deep blue/green gradient + subtle noise texture + soft vignette.

Add a smooth curved rail (gold/bronze) at the bottom arc and a thin inner border.

Remove harsh gradients and flat colors.

Seats should be subtle circles with clean outline, and the “You” seat should have a premium glow ring.

3) Seats: show 5–7 seats cleanly and consistently

Place seats evenly along the bottom arc (use 5 seats on smaller widths, 7 on wide screens).

Each seat has:

Seat circle

Username/Empty label

Bet spots directly in front of seat (main bet center + optional side bet spots left/right)

Ensure seats are never too high/low; no overlap.

4) Fix side bets (they exist but user can’t tell how to activate/place them)

Side bets must be visibly placeable with clear spots:

Perfect Pairs (PP) spot

21+3 spot

When PP/21+3 toggles are ON, show the side bet circles glowing and clickable.

Allow placing chips on those side bet circles separately from main bet.

If toggles are OFF, side bet circles are hidden or disabled (dimmed).

Show side bet amounts next to the spots.

Ensure side bet payouts resolve and display in the round result log.

5) Chips: fix look + stacking + sizing

Replace current chips with clean Vegas chips: clear denomination text, proper ring design, shadow, and consistent color palette.

Chips placed on table must stack neatly at the bet spot (small offsets).

No random floating chips; clamp chip positions to the bet spot anchor.

Cap visible stack to e.g. 6 chips, then show “+N” badge for extra.

6) Cards: fix dealing animation and landing positions (it looks bad now)

Add a shoe position near dealer (top right is fine) and deal from there.

Deal order must look like real blackjack:

First card to each active seat (left to right), then dealer upcard

Second card to each active seat, then dealer hole card (face down)

Cards must slide smoothly to seat hand anchors and stack/fan slightly.

Dealer hand area centered under dealer label; dealer cards aligned and not overlapping weirdly.

Hand value badge should be small and positioned consistently near the hand, not on top of cards.

7) Buttons/UI cleanup (keep it minimal + premium)

During BETTING: show chip selector + bet controls (Undo/Clear/Repeat/2x) + Deal button.

During ACTION: hide chip selector and show only action buttons for the active hand: Hit / Stand / Double (and Split if enabled).

Keep layout stable; don’t push the table up/down when switching phases.

8) Sounds (clean)

Chip place sound (soft) when placing chips.

Card deal sound (paper flick) per dealt card.

Win/lose sound at the end.

Respect mute toggle; default muted until user interaction.

9) Visual polish

Add subtle glow on active seat/active hand.

Add a soft shadow under cards and chips.

Add gentle animations only (no cheesy effects).

10) Deliverables

Refactor BlackjackTable to use a single consistent positioning/anchor system.

Implement proper side bet placement UX (spots + toggle behavior).

Replace felt/rail styling with premium table styling.

Fix chip visuals and chip stacking at bet spots.

Fix dealing animation and card landing positions so it looks like real live blackjack.

Keep blackjack game logic and provably fair shuffle intact (do not change outcomes).
