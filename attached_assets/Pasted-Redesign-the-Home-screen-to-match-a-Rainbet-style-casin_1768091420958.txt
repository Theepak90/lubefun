Redesign the Home screen to match a Rainbet-style casino lobby layout (clean, modern, content-rich) while keeping our existing theme/colors and game routes.

Goal

The current home is too empty. Build a real “casino lobby” homepage with:

Top promo banners

Live wins feed

Recently played

Game categories / filters

Horizontal game carousels with icons

Search bar

Responsive + smooth scrolling

1) Header / Top area

Keep the current top navbar (balance + wallet + rewards), but make the home content start under it cleanly.

Add a small “Casino / Sports” toggle at the top-left of the content area (Sports can be disabled/coming soon).

2) Promo banner row (like Rainbet)

Create a horizontal banner carousel (3 banners visible on desktop, swipeable on mobile):

Banner A: “New Release” + CTA “Play Now” (link to Dice or Roulette)

Banner B: “Daily Spin” + CTA “Open Lootbox” (link to Daily Spin)

Banner C: “Challenges / Weekly Raffle” + CTA “View More” (link can be stub)

Use premium card styling: rounded corners, subtle glow, gradient overlays.

Use placeholder images/gradients if no assets.

3) Live Wins panel (right side on desktop)

Add a “LIVE WINS” card that updates every ~2–5 seconds with random entries like:

brad22 — Dice — +$6.74

luna_7 — Roulette — +$58.10

Make it feel believable: mostly small wins, occasionally medium, very rarely big.

It must be labeled “Simulated (demo)” for now.

Add a small trophy icon and smooth scrolling animation.

4) “Recent Wins” ticker row (optional but nice)

Add a horizontal ticker strip under banners: recent results bubbles (game icon + amount).

5) Game rows (carousels)

Create these sections (each a horizontal scroll row of game cards):

Originals (Dice, Coinflip, Mines, Plinko, Roulette, Blackjack, Daily Spin)

Popular (top 4–6 cards, can duplicate but reorder)

Recommended (personalized placeholder)

Each game card should include:

Icon / image placeholder

Name

“Players” count (fake for now)

Optional “Hot” tag

Click navigates to the existing route (do not break routes)

6) Search + Filters (like Rainbet)

Add a search bar that filters game cards by name.

Add filter buttons: “All”, “Originals”, “Live Casino” (can be stub), “Slots” (stub)

For now only “All” and “Originals” need to work; others show “Coming soon”.

7) Sidebar improvements (home navigation)

Keep existing left sidebar, but add Home sections like: Home, Favorites (stub), Recently Played.

Add “Originals” expandable section similar to Rainbet style (clean).

8) UI style requirements

Match Rainbet spacing: tighter, content-rich, but not cluttered.

Cards must look premium (rounded 16–20px, soft shadow, minimal borders).

Smooth hover states (lift + glow).

Fully responsive:

Desktop: banners + live wins side-by-side

Mobile: banners stacked, live wins collapses into a small panel

9) Data + structure

Keep everything demo-friendly: live wins and players count are simulated.

Build reusable components: BannerCarousel, GameRow, GameCard, LiveWins, SearchFilters.

Do NOT change game logic or wallet logic; homepage only.

Deliverable: a Rainbet-style homepage/lobby with banners, carousels, search/filters, and a live wins panel, wired to existing game routes and matching our theme.
