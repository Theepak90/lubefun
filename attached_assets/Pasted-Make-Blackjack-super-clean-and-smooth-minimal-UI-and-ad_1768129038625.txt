Make Blackjack super clean and smooth (minimal UI) and add multiple bets by allowing the user to play 2–3 hands at once.

Clean UI (remove clutter)

Remove ALL big popups/overlays/toasts: no “YOU WIN” popup, no center WIN badge, no large banners.

Replace them with ONE slim StatusBar under the dealer area that shows:

phase text: Dealing… / Your turn / Dealer turn / Round complete

result text: You win +$X / Push / Dealer busts

Result text should fade after 2–3 seconds (non-blocking).

Keep the table area clean: cards + chips only, no extra floating labels.

Keep bottom controls minimal:

During round: Hit, Stand, Double (and Split only when available)

Between rounds: Rebet, New Hand, Clear (small)

Show bet info in one compact row: Bet per hand, Hands, Total bet, Balance.

Multiple bets (multi-hand)

Add a selector in betting phase: Hands = 1 / 2 / 3 (default 1).

Add Bet per hand amount (chips add to this).

Compute: totalBet = betPerHand * handsCount.

Prevent starting a hand if balance < totalBet.

Deal player cards into separate hands (Hand 1, Hand 2, Hand 3) with clean spacing.

Player plays hands one at a time:

highlight active hand with a subtle glow/outline

show small label near controls: Hand 1/3, Hand 2/3, etc.

actions apply only to active hand

Dealer plays once after all player hands finish.

Settle each hand independently and show a single summary in StatusBar:

e.g. 2 wins, 1 loss • Net +$X

“Rebet” behavior

After a round, keep the last betPerHand + handsCount pre-selected.

If balance is enough, allow Rebet instantly.

If not enough, reduce handsCount automatically (3→2→1) OR prompt with a tiny inline warning (no popup).

Smoother pacing

Add realistic dealing delays (250–450ms per card) + easing animation for slide from shoe.

Add short pauses between phases (dealer reveal, dealer hits, settlement).

State safety (no glitches)

Implement strict state machine:
BETTING -> DEALING -> PLAYER_HANDS -> DEALER -> SETTLEMENT -> BETTING

Block spam clicks/double submits; add idempotency for start/rebet/newhand.

Ensure no negative balances and no duplicate payouts.

Deliver the updated UI/CSS and game logic so it feels premium, clean, and supports multi-hand betting.
