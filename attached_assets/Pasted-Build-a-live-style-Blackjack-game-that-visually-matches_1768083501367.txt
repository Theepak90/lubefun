Build a live-style Blackjack game that visually matches the reference images: a dealer behind a semi-circle table, seat circles, chips placed on betting spots, and realistic card dealing animations. This must be fully functional (play-money for now) with correct Blackjack rules and clean UX.

1) Table + Seats (Live Blackjack look)

Replace the current Blackjack UI with a full table scene:

Dealer area at the top center (dealer avatar optional placeholder).

A semi-circle felt table with 7 seats (circles) along the bottom arc (like the image).

Each seat has: seat circle, username label (or “Empty”), and a bet spot in front of the seat.

User must click a seat to sit down (only one seat for the current user).

When seated, show a small panel for controls (bet, actions) but keep the focus on the table.

2) Chips + Betting (main bet + side bets)

Add Vegas-style chips (clean numbers) and allow placing chips on:

Main bet (per hand)

Side bets (at least: Perfect Pairs and 21+3 as optional toggles)

Bets are placed by selecting a chip, then clicking the bet spot(s).

Add buttons: Undo, Clear, Repeat, Double Bet (doubles current bet amounts if balance allows).

Allow multiple simultaneous hands ONLY if the user activates:

“Multi-hand” toggle (up to 3 hands), each with its own main bet spot.

Validate: cannot exceed balance; show clean inline error.

3) Game Flow (like live BJ)

Round phases:

BETTING OPEN (timer optional, e.g., 8–12s)

DEALING (dealer deals one card at a time around table)

PLAYER ACTIONS (Hit/Stand/Double/Split if enabled)

DEALER PLAY (reveal hole card, draw to rules)

PAYOUTS + short results pause

Seat selection + betting must feel like live tables: user places bet, then clicks “Deal” (or auto-start when betting closes).

4) Correct Blackjack Rules (configurable)

Use standard rules and make them explicit in the UI:

Dealer stands on 17 (choose “stand on soft 17” OR “hit soft 17” and implement consistently; default stand).

Blackjack pays 3:2.

Double allowed on first two cards.

Split allowed (optional v1; if too complex, ship without split first but structure code to add later).

Surrender optional (off by default).

Side bets:

Perfect Pairs: paytable by pair type (mixed/colored/perfect)

21+3: evaluate player’s first two cards + dealer upcard (flush/straight/3kind/straight flush)

Ensure all payouts update balance correctly and log results.

5) Provably Fair / Deterministic Dealing

The deck order must be generated server-side using provably-fair seeds: server seed + client seed + nonce, then shuffle deterministically.

Each round increments nonce and uses a fresh deck/shoe logic.

Provide a Fair Play modal showing: server seed hash, client seed, nonce, and a way to rotate seeds.

IMPORTANT: do not reveal the server seed until rotated, but ensure past rounds can be verified.

6) Realistic Animations (must look good)

Deal animation: cards slide from dealer shoe area to each seat’s hand position in sequence (player hands first, then dealer upcard, then second card round, then dealer hole card).

Card placement must align to table spots (hand stacking with slight offsets).

Chip placement animation: chip drops onto bet spot with a tiny bounce.

When a hand busts/wins, highlight that hand briefly (subtle glow).

7) Sound Effects (premium but not annoying)

Add sound system with global mute toggle (default muted; must only play after user interaction):

Chip place sound (soft click)

Card deal sound (paper flick)

Win chime / lose thud (subtle)

Throttle sounds so multiple quick actions don’t spam.

8) Results + Profit UI (consistent across games)

After each round, show a clean toast for ~1s:

“You won $X.XX (profit $Y.YY)” OR “You lost $X.XX (profit -$X.XX)”

Log each round into the shared Recent Results panel.

Integrate the Profit Tracker popup for Blackjack (session profit, wagered, W/L).

9) Performance + Responsiveness

Must run smoothly on Replit preview.

Table scales for smaller screens (reduce seats to 5 on mobile or allow horizontal scroll).

10) Deliverables

A fully playable Blackjack table with seat selection, chip betting, dealing animations, actions, payouts, side bets, sounds, provably-fair deck generation, and clean UI.

Keep code modular: BlackjackTable, Seat, BetSpot, ChipSelector, Card, HandArea, useSound, provablyFairShuffle utilities.

Build this inside the existing app structure and keep styling consistent with the site (dark premium theme).
