Redesign the Blackjack UI to match a real live blackjack table (like the reference images). The current layout looks like a flat green rectangle with awkward card placement — replace it completely with a proper semi-circle table scene and correct seating + dealing positions.

1) Table Scene (must look like real live BJ)

Build a semi-circle felt table with a darker top background and a curved gold rail at the bottom edge.

Felt texture stays subtle (not noisy).

Add 7 seat circles along the curved edge (bottom arc). Each seat has a circle outline + label (“Empty” or username).

The current user’s seat should highlight with a clean glow and show “You”.

Dealer area at top center with “DEALER” label and avatar circle.

2) Correct Hand/Bet Positions (fix the “messy” card placement)

For each seat, define fixed coordinates/anchors for:

Main bet spot (in front of the seat)

Side bet spots (small circles next to main bet)

Player hand area (cards appear above the bet spot)

Dealer hand area: cards appear under DEALER label, centered.

Ensure cards never overlap incorrectly:

Player cards fan slightly with offsets

Dealer cards stack neatly with offsets

Make sure the facedown dealer hole card is visible and aligned (blue back).

3) Live-style Betting UI (chips on table, not random buttons)

Add a chip selector row at the bottom of the table (Vegas-style chips) and allow placing chips by:

Select chip → click a bet spot

Add controls: Undo, Clear, Repeat, Double (for bets) in a compact row.

Add “Place Bet” button that only works when a main bet exists and betting phase is open.

Only show Hit/Stand/Double/Split buttons during the action phase, not always.

4) Realistic Dealing Animation

Add an animated “shoe” position near dealer.

Deal one card at a time from dealer shoe to each active seat + dealer, with a smooth slide + slight rotation.

The animation must land cards exactly on the seat hand anchors.

5) Clean Layout + Remove Weird Empty Space

Remove the huge empty center feel and fix proportions:

Table should fill the main content area nicely

Seats should be evenly spaced along the arc

Keep header minimal: “Live Blackjack”, Fair Play, Profit button.

6) Keep all existing logic

Do NOT break blackjack rules/payouts/provably fair.

This task is primarily a UI/positioning/animation refactor with correct seat/bet/hand anchoring.

Deliverable

Updated BlackjackTable component with:

SVG/CSS curved table design (semi-circle)

Seat layout on arc

Correct card and chip placement anchors

Dealing animation that targets anchors

Result should visually match “live blackjack table” style, not a plain rectangle.
