Upgrade the Blackjack game to feel smooth, realistic, and premium.

1) Make the table look better (visual polish)

Improve felt texture: subtle noise/grain, soft vignette, gentle spotlight in center, richer blue/green felt gradient.

Add table depth: inner shadow on the table rim, soft highlight line on the top arc, better gold rails.

Add subtle ambient particles (very faint) + slow moving light sweep (optional).

Keep everything clean (no clutter), modern casino look.

2) Make gameplay pacing feel “real”

Right now rounds happen too fast. Add a round timeline with natural delays:

Deal animation: cards slide from shoe to positions with easing + slight rotation + bounce settle.

Delay between card deals (e.g. 250–450ms each card).

Delay after player action before dealer acts (e.g. 400–700ms).

Dealer reveals hole card with a flip animation (300–500ms).

Dealer hits with the same cadence as real.

Show small status text: “Dealing…”, “Dealer checks…”, “Dealer hits…”, “Round complete”.

3) Keep last bet on table after round reset

When the round ends (win/lose/push/blackjack), do NOT clear the bet immediately.

Keep chip stack on the betting spot and show a “Rebet” button.

If the user still has enough balance, automatically keep the last bet amount pre-selected for the next round (chips remain visually).

If balance is insufficient, gray out the chips and show “Insufficient balance” and require lowering bet.

Add “Clear Bet” button to remove chips manually.

4) Prevent glitchy state resets

Implement a finite state machine for blackjack states:
BETTING -> DEALING -> PLAYER_TURN -> DEALER_TURN -> SETTLEMENT -> BETTING

Block inputs that don’t belong to the current state (no double hit, no bet changes mid-hand, no rapid spam clicking).

Use a single roundId and ignore late animations/results from previous rounds.

5) Deliverables

Update UI components and CSS for premium table.

Add card animation component (CSS transitions or requestAnimationFrame).

Add lastBetAmount persistence and “Rebet” flow.

Keep existing balance logic but improve UX so it feels slow
