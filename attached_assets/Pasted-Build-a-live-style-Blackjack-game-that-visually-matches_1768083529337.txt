Build a live-style Blackjack game that visually matches the reference images: a dealer behind a semi-circle table, seat circles, chips placed on betting spots, and realistic card dealing animations. This must be fully functional (play-money for now) with correct Blackjack rules and clean UX.

1) Table + Seats (Live Blackjack look)

Replace the current Blackjack UI with a full table scene:

Dealer area at the top center (dealer avatar optional placeholder).

A semi-circle felt table with 7 seats (circles) along the bottom arc (like the image).

Each seat has: seat circle, username label (or “Empty”), and a bet spot in front of the seat.

User must click a seat to sit down (only one seat for the current user).

When seated, show a small panel for controls (bet, actions) but keep the focus on the table.

2) Chips + Betting (main bet + side bets)

Add Vegas-style chips (clean numbers) and allow placing chips on:

Main bet (per hand)

Side bets (at least: Perfect Pairs and 21+3 as optional toggles)

Bets are placed by selecting a chip, then clicking the bet spot(s).

Add buttons: Undo, Clear, Repeat, Double Bet (doubles current bet amounts if balance allows).

Allow multiple simultaneous hands ONLY if the user activates:

“Multi-hand” toggle (up to 3 hands), each with its own main bet spot.

Validate: cannot exceed balance; show clean inline error.

3) Game Flow (like live BJ)

Round phases:

BETTING OPEN (timer optional, e.g., 8–12s)

DEALING (dealer deals one card at a time around table)

PLAYER ACTIONS (Hit/Stand/Double/Split if enabled)

DEALER PLAY (reveal hole card, draw to rules)

PAYOUTS + short results pause

Seat selection + betting must feel like live tables: user places bet, then clicks “Deal” (or auto-start when betting closes).

4) Correct Blackjack Rules (configurable)

Use standard rules and make them explicit in the UI:

Dealer stands on 17 (choose “stand on soft 17” OR “hit soft 17” and implement consistently; default stand).

Blackjack pays 3:2.

Double allowed on first two cards.

Split allowed (optional v1; if too complex, ship without split first but structure code to add later).

Surrender optional (off by default).

Side bets:

Perfect Pairs: paytable by pair type (mixed/colored/perfect)

21+3: evaluate player’s first two cards + dealer upcard (flush/straight/3kind/straight flush)

Ensure all payouts update balance correctly and log results.
